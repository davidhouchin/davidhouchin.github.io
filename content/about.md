I am a software developer in Washington State.  
I enjoy rural areas, value peace and quiet, and love the rain.  

Things that I am passionate about:
 
- [Free Software](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html)

- [Pinball](https://pinside.com/pinball/community/pinsiders/strikekat) (Real and Emulated)

- [Metal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_metal) (Almost any varient of Death Metal, but also Progressive, Groove, Black, etc) (Recently, electronic is growing on me)

I don't have a strong preference on GNU/Linux distributions, but I generally use [Fedora](https://getfedora.org/). I like ThinkPads and use a [P53](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Laptop/Lenovo#P_series) for most work and games, and an [X1 Yoga 2nd Gen](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Lenovo_ThinkPad_X1_Yoga_2nd_Generation) for small/mobile tasks and drawing. I type using a [keyboard.io](https://shop.keyboard.io/) ([My Firmware](https://github.com/strikekat/Model01-Firmware/blob/master/Model01-Firmware.ino)) , and before that a [Kinesis Advantage 2](https://kinesis-ergo.com/shop/advantage2/). I currently use a [Logitech MX Ergo](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/mice/mx-ergo-wireless-trackball-mouse.html) to mouse, and before that (and still occasionally) a [CST L-Trac](https://xkeys.com/l-tracblue.html).
